# Unsupervised Document Clustering with Cluster Topic Identification

This is a repository for the paper 'Unsupervised Document Clustering with Cluster Topic Identification' to be published in the 
Office for National Statistics' working paper series. 

The paper details a pipeline that can be used to cluster documents in an unsupervised way with a suggested automated procedure 
for identifying a cluster's topic. 

There is an accompanying Jupyter notebook taht details an example of the pipeline as set out in the paper.
